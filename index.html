      <h1>Marie (Mimi) Royal</h1>
      <p>
      Marie, or as she was mostly known as Mimi by her friends and family, was born on December 14, 1937 in Kankakee, Illinois. She passed away on February 17, 2025 in Vancouver, Washington.

      Growing up in Kankakee, Mimi was surrounded by family: her parents James and Rosella Chaney, as well as her siblings Jerome, Earl, Dick, Jim, Bill, Dorothy, Helen, and Anita. At age 18, she moved out to southern California for college. Mimi lived in Torrance, California for over 65 years. Itâ€™s where she raised her son, Rob, and had a steady 30-year career with Rockwell International.
